The Tongva Taraxat Paxaavxa Conservancy was created to steward lands in
Tovaangar, the traditional Tongva region, encompassing the greater Los Angeles basin.
The Conservancy has received land back, and is working to create a community center
for Indigenous people, maintain cultural practices, have space for traditional Ceremony,
work on language revitalization, provide housing for Indigenous elders, and archive
community documents.

_Taraxat_ is the Tongva word for Indigenous people in the plural. It is used here
in the sense that this conservancy is intended to preserve the people and the culture
of the Tongva as well as the land. _Paxaavxa_ is the Tongva word for a piece of land.
